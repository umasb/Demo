select , where --> index
update & insert

A very good analogy is to think of a database index as an index in a book. If you have a book regarding countries and you are looking for India, then why would you flip through the entire book – which is the equivalent of a full table scan in database terminology – when you can just go to the index at the back of the book, which will tell you the exact pages where you can find information on India. Similarly, as a book index contains a page number, a database index contains a pointer to the row containing the value that you are searching for in your SQL.

whenever you add, delete, or update rows in the corresponding table, the same operations will have to be done to your index.
